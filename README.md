Ruggy is a Twitter bot that scans the latest tokens added to the Binance Smart Chain from CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, applies market analysis techniques such as Moving Averages to detect what tokens to buy and then tweets it's buy/sell announcements for what it finds. Mostly rug pulls. They're almost all scams.

I was good in theory...
